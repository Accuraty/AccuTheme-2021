# AccuTheme (formerly a modified AccuKit)

Shared utility functions for Dnn Platform projects. Things we keep needing and writing small bits of code for over the years that make sense to re-use.

AccuTheme functions can be called from 2sxc Views, RazorHost scripts, Skin files, or any server-side code that runs post-compiled.

Reminder: Methods must be `public static`.
